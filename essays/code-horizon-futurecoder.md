*"The function of good software is to make the complex appear to be simple." - Grady Booch*

I've been learning how to program for at least 3 years now. Before I started, I was in pre-engineering, and the course I took was intro to programming. When I first began programming, it was quite confusing. The first language I wrote my "Hello world!" program was in C, and the gap between understanding how data works and just trying to complete a programming assignment is huge. 

## Programming from an Electrical Engineer to a Software Engineer

I spent the last 5 years as an Electrical Engineering student and over the course of my studies, I developed an interest in Software Engineering and Computer Engineering. Electrical engineering and software engineering go hand-and-hand in some cases, but electrical engineers only use a portion of the concepts of computer science so there is much to adjust to. Electrical engineering primarily deals with the study, design, and application of electrical systems, devices, and components. This includes areas such as power generation and distribution, circuit design, electronics, electromagnetism, and signal processing. While software engineering focuses on the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software systems and applications. Software engineers work with programming languages, algorithms, data structures, and software development methodologies to create software products that run on various computing platforms. I enjoy the process of creating complex code that solves real-world problems and the joy of overcoming the challenge. For my undergraduate project, I created a game with Python to implement a Reinforcement Learning technique such that a machines can play strategically against each other. While the project was compelling and challenging, it felt highly rewarding to see the end result. As an engineer programming is a tool for us to problem solve, but after I completed my undergraduate project, I wanted to pursue a more focused education into software engineering, hopefully Data Science as a master's degree. So after I earned my Bachelor degree, I decided to do one more semester at UH Manoa to learn more about what it means to be a software engineer.

## Beyond the Horizon as a Coder

In the software engineering course thus far, I've developed a professional portfolio, learned how to code in Javascript and there are much more projects to be explored. I hope to improve on my problem solving skills, and take these assets with me for my future education and career. My long term goal is to enter graduate school pursuing a Data Science Master's Degree.
