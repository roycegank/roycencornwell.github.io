*"We don't make releases 'when it's ready,' we make releases 'when it's good enough.'"*â€“ Linus Torvald

In ICS 314, software engineering the course significantly enhanced my software engineering skills. Particularly through engaging with the Work-Of-the-Day (WODs). these daily coding exercises helped build a solid foundation for understanding a wide range of programming problems. Complementing this practical approach, the assignment of technical essays helped hone my writing skills. It taught me not only ways to formatting documents in Markdown but also how to create compelling and informative content. The course provided a thorough introduction to the use of GitHub, specifically in managing workflows within software development projects. In addition, there are a few key concepts from the course that have I learned a lot from and have shaped my understanding of software engineering.

### Development Environments

Development environments refer to the settings and tools where software engineers design, develop, test, and deploy applications. These environments provide the necessary framework to manage project dependencies, integrate software components, and track version control, ensuring consistent behavior across various stages of the development process. In the context of my software engineering course, tools such as IntelliJ was used to give students hands-on experience with professional-grade integrated development environments (IDEs).

IntelliJ has been a key tool in enhancing my understanding of coding styles and managing JavaScript files on a GitHub repo for WODs, the final project and starting my own project. Being able to use it with GitHub, allowed efficient version control and organization of my project files. Additionally, the integration of ESLint within IntelliJ enforces a consistent coding style, forcing my code to adhere to established best practices throughout my coding assignments.

### Agile Project Management

Agile project management is a flexible and iterative approach that emphasizes continuous improvement and quick response to feedback in software development. Issue Driven Project Management (IDPM) applies these principles by dividing projects into small, manageable tasks documented as GitHub issues, each designed to be completed within a short timeframe. This method enhances team collaboration and adaptability, ensuring that projects stay aligned with agile methodologies.

In the final weeks of the ICS 314 course, IDPM guidelines was completely new to me in terms of organizing team projects in GitHub. This approach allowed my group to effectively divide work into manageable sub-tasks and prioritize effectively during our final project on the Manoa Reclaim web application. By structuring tasks to be completed within 72 hours and documenting them as GitHub issues, our team could maintain a clear focus and ensure consistent progress. The use of GitHub for task and branch management, along with regular weekly meetings, help create better coordination among team members, although there were still some misunderstandings in the beginning since I was new to making an IDPM.

### In the End of Software Engineering

There were several other concepts not mentioned above that were helpful in creating my understanding of Software Engineering, but the concept that had the biggest impact on my understanding was Agile Project Management. The steps of project management in GitHub include setting up repositories, managing branches, reviewing pull requests, and integrating changes taught me much about how crucial it is to maintain efficient workflows. Project management helped me understand these GitHub functionalities a software engineer, as they enable better management over the development process and collaboration among team members. I indeed confirmed tha project management constitutes almost 80% of what software engineers do in a project, more so than programming itself. This is because the initial stages of getting a project off the ground, along with careful design and planning, take a significant amount of time and form the backbone of successful software development. I hope to appreciate this process when I get into my career and ICS 314 helped me achieve this understanding.
