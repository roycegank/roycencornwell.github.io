*"JavaScript is the only language that I'm aware of that people feel they don't need to learn before they start using it." - Douglas Crockford*

Since I began learning Javascript, much of what I learned from other programming languages such as C, C++, and Python came to mind while working through the FreeBootCamp. Variable assignments, functions, arrays, objects, loops and much more. There are many similarities that I could recognize from other programming languages. This is the first time using Javascript, but after using C for years, it didn't take long for me to become comfortable with the syntax. In fact, in many ways so far Javascript simplifies the syntax while improving on the functionality of coding. Some lines like C still need to end with a semicolon. However, creating objects and functions has never felt so intuitive. 

## Functions and syntax in C and Javascript

### Example: JavaScript Function

```javascript
function greet(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

### Example: C Function

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void greet(char* name) {
    printf("Hello, %s!\n", name);
}
```
In my opinion, the syntax is straightforward. In the Javascript codeblock, you don't have to specify the type of the name parameter. Plus, the function directly returns the formatted string. In C, you must include standard libraries (like stdio.h for input/output functions) and explicitly declare the type of each parameter (char* name in this case). So setting up the function in C can take more time.

## Features in Javascript

I've talked about some of the syntax Javascript has that I enjoy, but there are many other features that I appreciate in Javascript (also features that I'm not aware of yet) that I would like to highlight. 

## Athletic Software Engineering

Ever hear people ragging on engineering companies for delivering late and way over budget? Well, some engineering jobs are really difficult, especially if the requirements and funding are undulating underneath you. Because of the nature of the problem, sometimes engineering firms require large amounts of engineers and workers, inviting further problems and delays.

The Honolulu Rail project at home has become this sort of poster child of failure, budget overrun and overall incompetence in Hawaii. Well, working though regulatory boards and fiscal procedures in Hawaii seems like it's a mind bogglingly difficult job to do. Granted, there might be some fishy stuff going on, but I refuse to believe that everyone is involved for nefarious reasons.

The problem of creating an unprecedented public transportation backbone on an island is difficult! I'm not sure we would have done it right, even if the best people were involved.

## In the context of relationships

So in the end, we realize that all engineering and programming is there for a reason - to serve human needs. Maybe that's why those things are difficult, because they both involve humans and are for humans.

Relationships, regardless if they're romantic or not take work. Humans are fickle creatures and relationships can come and go with the wind. To properly maintain something over time requires work. Family takes work. Marriage takes work. We live to figure out what works and what doesn't and hope that as we move forward we're improving.

Relationships have always been difficult, and by nature will continue to be so.

## Okay!

So back to the original premise; why is being one of the club officers so difficult?

And the final answer - it's supposed to be difficult, and it's supposed to challenge you, just like everything else that humans do that is difficult: programming, engineering, engaging in relationships, pondering the universe, etc.

Ultimately the question you should really ask yourself if something if particularly difficult is then "is it worth it"? That is something that is context specific and only you can answer yourself.
