*"AI is an Existential Threat to Humanity."*– Geoffrey Hinton

### I. Introduction
In education, AI poses a precarious position when the topic of learning and cheating comes into the conversation. AI can help with coding, writing technical essays, and more. Because of this, it provides productivity, time-saving, and great potential for learning difficult concepts in education. However, AI sparks debate on this topic, proclaiming that AI reduces the quality of learning by writing code/essays for students. In software engineering, AI also plays a pivotal role by automating tasks such as code generation and testing, significantly increasing efficiency and reducing human error. Additionally, AI enables predictive analytics in software development, helping teams anticipate problems and understand user behavior to improve software design and functionality. AI achieves this by leveraging machine learning models, natural language processing, and image generation technologies to understand and respond to user queries, create content, and perform tasks across various domains. In the ICS 314 course, Software Engineering I, students were encouraged to use AI tools to help learn difficult coding concepts and provide ideas on how to design/test websites and solve coding problems. I was even encouraged to write all technical essays using AI. Throughout the course, I made use of mostly [ChatGPT 4.0](https://chat.openai.com/), but I have also tried a coding-specific AI platforms such as [Blackbox](https://www.blackbox.ai/). I'll be discussing my own experience using AI and my thoughts on it throughout the ICS 314 course.

### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

  1. Experience WODs e.g. E18

For Experience Work-Of-the Day (WOD), assignments were given about a programming concept, or practice on a programming language or system (e.g. Javascript programming or React). In each of these assignments, we were given a certain amount of time to complete the WOD for self-practice. At times, the instructions can be unclear for me so I relied on AI to help write code for part of the problem to complete the WOD on time. At the end, I would view the solution video on how the problem can be coded and have noticed some similarities between the video solution and AI coding. AI was rather reliable and helpful to help solve coding problems for Experience WOD assignments, but as the semester progressed, software engineering problems became more complex, so AI wasn't as reliable or became less convenient to use.
     
  2. In-class Practice WODs

For the practice WODs, I didn't rely on AI as much. Most in-class practice WODs, allowed students to converse with our classmates so I asked for help whenever I was lost. One other reason I didn't rely on AI for these were because I wanted to use my critical-thinking and other resources to practice my coding skills. When other classmates didn't know how to solve the problem, that's when I relied on asking AI for help. For example, when recreating the [Morning Brew](https://www.morningbrewhawaii.com/) homepage for a coffee business I asked ChatGPT the following:

"I am building a web application using React and React-Bootstrap. I want to center some text inside a Container component, but I'm not sure how to do it. Could you show me how to correctly apply centering of text within a React-Bootstrap Container?"

With questions prompts that are detailed like this, I'm usually able to get a good response. Since I have GPT 4.0 I was also able to provide a screenshot of the page of how I would like it to be styled so it can be useful.

  3. In-class WODs

For in-class WODs, I thought it was useful at times, but at the same time I didn't feel the quality of learning was there. It was as if I used it to solve the problem for only earning the WOD grade. Even when the class was given a sufficient amount of time to solve the WOD task, it felt short so I often copied and pasted the instructions from the WOD webpage then modified the prompt so that the AI understood my needs.

  4. Essays

I have used AI to write essays and provide a template for technical essays. It helped that most of the essays were "freeform" when writing them. Most prompts I would use for AI were for spelling/grammar check. Since technical essays were also written in markdown, I also used AI to help format the page to look organized and give helpful commands on "How to insert a link in .md?" or "How do I insert an image sized smaller?"

  5. Final project

For the final project, I'm almost relying on ChatGPT or AI all the time. In the course, students were given assignments called "digits" on how to use a meteor template to create a website that reads/writes information to a database and more. The final project is quite similar to the digits assignment so I used techniques used from that assignment for my final project, but the complexity of the website my group is building is high so I have been asking ChatGPT questions such as "How can I alter the database for lost items in the ListItem.jsx to reflect in the LostItem.js component?" Basically prompts must be specific for AI to be useful and I still often have problems with some specific tasks. However, it is still more useful than relying on my own knowledge.

  6. Learning a concept / tutorial

When learning concepts, AI has helped but not as much as the tutorial itself. I would often understand what the professor is teaching or the reading when given a reading module. The only time I used AI was when going through a Javascript tutorial with FreeDataCamp such as "Help me understand what the instructions would like me to do." 

  7. Answering a question in class or in Discord

In class, students were often encouraged to use AI to answer questions such as "What is a Design pattern?" or even "What are the benefits and drawbacks of using AI". To be honest, I didn't like using AI for this because I wanted to provide my own feedback/opinion rather than an AI. I think overall it wasn't useful for answering questions such as these because AI isn't good at providing ones own opinion.

  8. Asking or answering a smart-question

For this, I never used AI to ask or answer a smart-question. Before I would answer a smart-question I would usually search for answers online. For asking questions, I would know enough about the problem I'm facing and how to ask it to obtain a good response from a student or professor. Not that I claim to be able to ask smart-questions well all the time, but I felt AI could not replicate my questions as well as myself.

  9. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”

I have had many instances of using AI to give me a coding example. Listing them all would be exhaustive but for example, I would ask ChatGPT, "Explain how the .reduce() method in JavaScript compares to achieving the same functionality using a traditional for loop."

  10. Explaining code

For explaining code, I have used AI to do this quite often. When I'm looking at solutions to a WOD or a student's code, I often rely on AI to help explain code blocks that are confusing to me. 

  11. Writing code

For writing code, I have used it in various fields. Mainly, the in-class WODs and the final project as mentioned above. In these fields I often feel lost at what I should write to perform a task such as reading/writing to a database or interpreting an instruction from a WOD more clearly. Having AI write my code helps provide me a template to work off of. 

  12. Documenting code

Although AI offers tools to automate code documentation, I've primarily used AI for adding comments and labeling code segments that involved AI (in-class WOD), because I haven't had an opportunity to use it fully with documentation.

  13. Quality assurance 

Although I have used AI to create debugging or testing for the final project, I have also yet to utilize AI to create 

  14. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed above

I've used AI or ChatGPT a lot in other computer science classes such as Data Structures & Algorithms. It's very similar to how I would use it in ICS 314, Software Engineering I.

### III. Impact on Learning and Understanding:

In the ICS 314, tools such as ChatGPT served as auxiliary tutors, providing quick assistance with coding problems, explaining new programming concepts, and helping debug issues, which aided in my learning process. However, the ease of AI assistance also posed risks of undermining deep learning and critical thinking skills, as reliance on AI for tasks like code generation sometimes detered engagement with challenging problems such as with in-class WODs or the Experiences. Besides that, AI proved to be helpful in managing routine tasks, allowing me to focus on more complex and creative aspects of software projects while staying productive.

### IV. Practical Applications:

In a real-world setting, the Hawaii Annual Code Challenge (HACC), demonstrates its value in automating tasks, analyzing data, and enhancing software development. At HACC, AI helped create predictive models that analyzed real-time data to forecast trends, aiding decision-making processes. AI also improved software development by handling repetitive tasks and testing, speeding up the deployment of tech solutions. Not only at HACC but in companies at specialize in software engineering, AI has improved development efficiency by automating testing, reducing errors, and accelerating product delivery. While AI boosts productivity and supports complex solutions, it also prompts concerns about over-reliance and the potential undervaluation of human skills.

### V. Challenges and Opportunities:

Throughout my use of AI in the ICS 314 course, I've encountered challenges, particularly regarding the quality of learning. Heavy reliance on AI for tasks like coding can reduce engagement and impede critical thinking. For example, in the final project using the Meteor framework, AI required specific prompts to be effective, which sometimes only provided a superficial understanding of complex problems. One common example when using AI for this was when I asked ChatGPT to reference javascript files from other folders or to leave changes on code blocks that are required for a function. Despite these issues, there are opportunities for integrating AI more effectively in software engineering education. By using AI as a supplementary tool and developing clear guidelines for its use, students can engage more fully with the material while benefiting from AI's efficiency, and allowing AI to integrate into daily tasks.

### VI. Comparative Analysis:

In traditional methods, relying on direct interaction and manual problem-solving, tend to provide deeper conceptual understanding and critical thinking, which is essential for for not only software engineers, but for engineers of any discipline. These methods encourage students to navigate challenges without immediate solutions, promoting long-term retention. In contrast, AI-enhanced learning offers immediate problem-solving assistance and access to vast information, which can improve engagement and make learning more dynamic. However, this convenience can sometimes reduce the necessity for deep problem-solving, potentially impacting the development of independent skills and detailed knowledge retention. At the same time, traditional teaching methods can introduce time consumption when spending time on a complex concept. 

### VII. Future Considerations:

As AI technologies advance, their integration into education will most likely deepen, providing more sophisticated tools for learning and development. AI's ability to automate routine tasks and offer predictive insights can free up valuable time for educators and students, allowing for a greater focus on creative problem-solving in software projects. However, the challenges of over-reliance and superficial learning need addressing. Educators must consider implementing AI as a supplementary tool rather than a replacement for traditional learning methods. A good example mentioned throughout the essay is the encouragement of AI throughout the ICS 314 course, but asking the students to be thoughtful in their prompts and ask for clues moreso than answers, provide good quality of learning.

### VIII. Conclusion:

In the ICS 314 course, AI tools like ChatGPT have significantly aided my understanding of software engineering workflows. It has helped automate routine tasks and provided real-time coding assistance, which proved vital in our final project by streamlining our development process and debugging. Despite these benefits, software engineers are still needed. AI requires human insight and creativity to solve complex problems and make ethical decisions. This experience highlighted that while AI can mimic many engineering tasks, it cannot replace the critical human elements of innovation and judgment in software engineering. There is a need for clear guidelines and ethical considerations regarding AI's use. By using AI as a tool efficiently with traditional teaching methods, software engineering education can evolve to meet the demands of an increasingly digital world, preparing students not only to use technology but to innovate and lead its future developments. In fact, a large portion of this essay was written with the use of AI to help lay my thoughts on a template.
