*" In the world of hackers, the kind of answers you get to your technical questions depends as much on the way you ask the questions as on the difficulty of developing the answer. " - Eric S. Raymond*

In school during lectures, there will always be a time when we have a burning question to ask the professor or teacher whether the topic being discussed is confusing, stuck on a homework assignment or anything really. On one side, there are those who will shy away from asking questions and for one reason their question might seem 'stupid' to others. On the other hand, there are those who will ask their question anyway no matter if the question is 'smart' or 'stupid'. Most professors whom I've been lectured from say, "there is no such thing as a dumb question, ask them anyway". However, is that really the case? Even if the question is on the same topic, can the question still seem foolish or is there a way we can ask them a 'smart' way to receive a meaningful answer? Well, it may vary on the topic or level the question is asked, but when it comes to a technical topic, it turns out there are stupid questions and there are smart ways to ask them instead.

## What is a smart question?
