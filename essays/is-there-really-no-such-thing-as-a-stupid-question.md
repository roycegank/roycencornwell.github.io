*" In the world of hackers, the kind of answers you get to your technical questions depends as much on the way you ask the questions as on the difficulty of developing the answer. " - Eric S. Raymond*

In school during lectures, there will always be a time when we have a burning question to ask the professor or teacher whether the topic being discussed is confusing, being stuck on a homework assignment or other unrelated subjects. On one side, there are those who will shy away from asking questions and for one reason, their question might seem 'stupid' to others from the asker's perspective. On the other hand, there are those who will ask their question anyway no matter if the question is 'smart' or 'stupid'. Most professors whom I've been lectured from say, "There is no such thing as a dumb question, ask away." However, is that really the case? Even if the question is on the same topic, can the question still seem 'stupid' or 'silly', or is there a way we can ask a 'smart' way to receive a meaningful answer? Well, it may vary on the topic or level the question is asked, but when it comes to a technical background such as software engineering, it turns out there are stupid questions and there are smarter ways to ask them instead.

## What is a smart question?

A smart question is one that is thoughtfully formulated, clear, and demonstrates an understanding of the context and problem from the asker. In the context of software engineering, a smart question according to the essay, <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">*How To Ask Questions The Smart Way*</a> by Eric Raymond, respects those answering the question. For software engineers, it's crucial to ask "smart" questions for the quality of answers received often depends on the clarity and intelligence of the questions asked. Problem-solving and collaboration are a necessity, asking smart questions can lead to more efficient and quick solutions. How to ask smart questions can very on the format. On Stack Exchange or Stack Overflow, the community can provide answers to many technical questions.

### A look at a smart question

Let's look at how a smart question is formulated on Stack Overflow. Here we have the question, "<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77720836/given-an-array-of-strings-words-find-the-number-of-pairs-where-either-the-strin">Given an array of strings words, find the number of pairs where either the strings are equal or one string starts with another?</a>.</p>" Right here, it can be noted that the question is concise and is specific to what the asker would like answered. Basically, the developer is asking for an optimal solution to a problem encountered while doing competitive programming. It involves finding the number of pairs in an array of strings where either the strings are equal or one string starts with another. They provide examples and a solution they believe is naive and would Time Limit Exceed (TLE) on larger test cases. They mention considering implementing a Trie data structure but are unsure how to do so and whether it would optimize the solution sufficiently. Here are a list of reasons why this is an example of a smart question:

1. Clear problem statement: The question is is outlines specific inquiries.
2. Shows prior effort: Since the developer has their own attempt at implementing a solution with code blocks
3. Requests for guidance: Instead of asking outright for a solution, the developer asks for guidance on how on potential approaches for optimizing their solution. They specifically mention considering the implementation of a Trie data structure. This also demonstrates openness to learning
4. Respectful Tone: The developer doesn't grovel nor makes demands for an answer to their problem, which is important when formulating smart questions. Groveling or making demands is not only disrespectful but is distracting from the actual problem statement.

There were quite a few answers provided since there are many ways to solve this particular problem statement, but this demonstrates how formulating a smart question enables those who respond to provide effective solutions. There are no comments in the post that ask for clarity of the question and the asker is able to receive a good answer.

### A bad question

Now, much discussion went into what is a smart question, but what about an example of a bad question? Let's take a look at this question, "<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77882675/using-1-function-and-an-array-to-control-a-lot-of-button">Using 1 function and an array to control a lot of button</a>"


## Asking Good Questions is a Skill

Asking the right questions will help you extract the answers you want. In most scenarios, it is not that the person answering is incapable, but you are not asking the right questions.
