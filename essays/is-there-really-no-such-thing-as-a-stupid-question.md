*" In the world of hackers, the kind of answers you get to your technical questions depends as much on the way you ask the questions as on the difficulty of developing the answer. " - Eric S. Raymond*

In school during lectures, there will always be a time when we have a burning question to ask the professor or teacher, whether the topic being discussed is confusing, being stuck on a homework assignment, or other unrelated subjects. On one side, there are those who will shy away from asking questions, and for one reason, their question might seem 'stupid' to others from the asker's perspective. On the other hand, there are those who will ask their question anyway, no matter if the question is 'smart' or 'stupid'. Most professors whom I've been lectured from say, "There is no such thing as a dumb question, ask away." However, is that really the case? Even if the question is on the same topic, can the question still seem 'stupid' or 'silly', or is there a way we can ask a 'smart' way to receive a meaningful answer? Well, it may vary depending on the topic or level the question is asked, but when it comes to a technical background such as software engineering, it turns out there are stupid questions and there are smarter ways to ask them instead.

## What is a smart question?

A smart question is one that is thoughtfully formulated, clear, and demonstrates an understanding of the context and problem from the asker. In the context of software engineering, a smart question, according to the essay, [*How To Ask Questions The Smart Way*](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) by Eric Raymond, respects those answering the question. For software engineers, it's crucial to ask "smart" questions for the quality of answers received often depends on the clarity and intelligence of the questions asked. Problem-solving and collaboration are necessities; asking smart questions can lead to more efficient and quick solutions. How to ask smart questions can vary in format. On Stack Exchange or Stack Overflow, the community can provide answers to many technical questions.

### A look at a smart question

Let's look at how a smart question is formulated on Stack Overflow. Here we have the question, "[Given an array of strings words, find the number of pairs where either the strings are equal or one string starts with another?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77720836/given-an-array-of-strings-words-find-the-number-of-pairs-where-either-the-strin)" Right here, it can be noted that the question is concise and is specific to what the asker would like answered. Basically, the developer is asking for an optimal solution to a problem encountered while doing competitive programming. It involves finding the number of pairs in an array of strings where either the strings are equal or one string starts with another. They provide examples and a solution they believe is naive and would Time Limit Exceed (TLE) on larger test cases. They mention considering implementing a Trie data structure but are unsure how to do so and whether it would optimize the solution sufficiently. Here are a list of reasons why this is an example of a smart question:

1. Clear problem statement: The question is outlines specific inquiries.
2. Shows prior effort: Since the developer has their own attempt at implementing a solution with code blocks
3. Requests for guidance: Instead of asking outright for a solution, the developer asks for guidance on potential approaches for optimizing their solution. They specifically mention considering the implementation of a Trie data structure. This also demonstrates openness to learning
4. Respectful Tone: The developer doesn't grovel nor makes demands for an answer to their problem, which is important when formulating smart questions. Groveling or making demands is not only disrespectful but is distracting from the actual problem statement.

There were quite a few answers provided since there are many ways to solve this particular problem statement, but this demonstrates how formulating a smart question enables those who respond to provide effective solutions. There are no comments in the post that ask for clarity of the question and the asker is able to receive a good answer.

### A bad question

Now, much discussion went into what is a smart question, but what about an example of a bad question? Let's take a look at this question, "[Using 1 function and an array to control a lot of button](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77882675/using-1-function-and-an-array-to-control-a-lot-of-button)". It can already be noticed that the title is vague and does not clearly indicate what problem the developer is facing or what they are asking. The question being asked revolves around a problem with controlling multiple buttons in an HTML file using a function. The developer attempted to create a function that takes the button number as input and uses an array to store the state and color information for each button. However, the function doesn't work as expected, and they seek help in troubleshooting the issue. Here is why this is NOT a smart question:

1. Lack of Details: The question lacks specific details about the program itself and had to edit the question to include the relevant HTML asked by a comment.
2. Vague Description of Issue: The developer states that they don't know why the code doesn't work, but they don't provide any specific details or errors encountered.
3. Assumption of Knowledge: The question assumes that readers will understand the context and requirements of the problem without providing sufficient background information as well.
5. Limited Effort Shown: The question does not demonstrate any effort on the part of the developer to debug the problem themselves or provide additional information that could help diagnose the issue.
6. Grammar and spelling: There is a lack of proper capitalization and punctuation in this question which many look at the question will not answer since this shows laziness on their part.

The answer to the question is mostly of comments for clarification or pointing out potential mistakes on the developer. So because this question was not formulated to thoughtfully as a smart question, it could not receive an answer at all and was closed.

## Asking Good Questions is a Skill

Asking the right questions will help you extract the answers one wants. In most scenarios, it is not that the person answering is incapable, but you may not be asking the right questions. Asking questions is normal and perfectly fine, but in the field of software engineering, if your question is not well thought out, it may be wasting not only others' time but your time as well. It can be seen in the examples above that for a smart question, the answers are concise, and the asker gets exactly what they need to solve the problem. On the other hand, a not smart question can lead to more questions toward the asker in clarifying what they need. Software engineers value their time, and it's important to ask smart questions for both their learning outcome and saving time for everyone.
