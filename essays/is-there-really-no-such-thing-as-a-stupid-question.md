*" In the world of hackers, the kind of answers you get to your technical questions depends as much on the way you ask the questions as on the difficulty of developing the answer. " - Eric S. Raymond*

In school during lectures, there will always be a time when we have a burning question to ask the professor or teacher whether the topic being discussed is confusing, being stuck on a homework assignment or other unrelated subjects. On one side, there are those who will shy away from asking questions and for one reason, their question might seem 'stupid' to others from the asker's perspective. On the other hand, there are those who will ask their question anyway no matter if the question is 'smart' or 'stupid'. Most professors whom I've been lectured from say, "There is no such thing as a dumb question, ask away." However, is that really the case? Even if the question is on the same topic, can the question still seem 'stupid' or 'silly', or is there a way we can ask a 'smart' way to receive a meaningful answer? Well, it may vary on the topic or level the question is asked, but when it comes to a technical background such as software engineering, it turns out there are stupid questions and there are smarter ways to ask them instead.

## What is a smart question?

A smart question is one that is thoughtfully formulated, clear, and demonstrates an understanding of the context and problem from the asker. In the context of software engineering, a smart question according to the essay, <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">*How To Ask Questions The Smart Way*</a> by Eric Raymond, respects those answering the question. For software engineers, it's crucial to ask "smart" questions for the quality of answers received often depends on the clarity and intelligence of the questions asked. Problem-solving and collaboration are a necessity, asking smart questions can lead to more efficient and quick solutions. How to ask smart questions can very on the format. On Stack Exchange or Stack Overflow, the community can provide answers to many technical questions.

## Asking Good Questions is a Skill

Asking the right questions will help you extract the answers you want. In most scenarios, it is not that the person answering is incapable, but you are not asking the right questions.
