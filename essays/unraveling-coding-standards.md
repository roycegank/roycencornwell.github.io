*"Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand."â€• Martin Fowler*

Up until I began taking classes in object-oriented programming, there was only a faint idea of what a coding standard meant for me. I wrote code to solve a problem, but that was all there was to it. In C language, let's say there's an array that I would like to return the sum using a function:

```c
int array(int arr[], int size) {
    int sum = 0;
    for(int i=0; i<size;i++) {
        sum += arr[i];
    }
    return sum;}
```

The code block above will compile and correctly calculate the sum of an array when the function is called. However, if someone has been programming for a long time and were to view this code block, there are clearly several mistakes if not errors in the code that do not follow coding standards. First of all, what is a coding standard? From the website [Codacy](https://blog.codacy.com/coding-standards#:~:text=Coding%20standards%2C%20also%20known%20as,and%20facilitate%20collaboration%20among%20developers.), Coding standards, also known as coding guidelines or programming style guides, are rules and conventions that developers follow when writing code. These rules define the code characteristics necessary to maintain a uniform codebase and facilitate collaboration among developers.
