## About

The Akamai Workforce Initiative is based on a well-supported rationale that Hawai‘i’s workforce needs are attainable through a modest increase in retaining STEM undergraduates and broadening participation to include more Native Hawaiians, women, and other groups underrepresented in STEM. As an intern, I was working at the W.M. Keck Observatory and my project was to update an existing safety system for a high-powered laser. Toward the end of the internship, I presented the outcome of my project in a symposium.

## Tasks

- Upgrading a programmable logic controller
- Reviewing existing designs & creating plans for integrating hardware
- Designed wire layouts for new hardware
- Built wires & cables for Lock-out-tag-out (LOTO) switches
- Worked in Ladder Logic programming (RSLogix500 programming environment)
- Tested & verified a programmable logic controller functionalities
- Practiced & gave a technical STEM presentation

The bulk of my work included updating code for the new high-powered laser so that it met safety standards for the organization. I was also assigned a mentor so that I can come to him for questions about how to implement these tasks

## Learning Outcome

The whole experience was my first time being exposed to an engineering project. Because of this, I was new to most of the protocols and had to ask many questions while taking notes to meet design specifications. Because the laser system was required to follow safety standards, I learned how engineers make their decisions on what to implement.

I could not include a source code for the PLC ladder logic system since this was sensitive information for the organization.
